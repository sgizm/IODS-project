*Write a short description about the course and add a link to your github repository here. This is an R markdown (.Rmd) file so you can use R markdown syntax. See the 'Useful links' page in the mooc area (chapter 1) for instructions.*


Data Science is the hot subject of our times. Thanks to the course, hopefully we will build abilities to work and manage with data.
